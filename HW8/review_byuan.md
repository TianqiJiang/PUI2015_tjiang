CLARITY: It's hard to say the plot is easy to read for me, although the plot is really cool. There are too many lines and points in one 3D plot. 

ESTHETICS: The blue color repersenting the hights of the yield, it make sense and helpful for reader.	

HONESTY: I would say the plot is honest and no deforming here.

SUGGESTIONS: In my opinion if the data from different time slot could be merge into one line, the plot would be easier to read.
